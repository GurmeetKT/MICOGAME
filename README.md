# My cookie Microgame: 
//The controls are the aroows and the space bar. You play by avoiding the obstacles and collecting cookie as a prize.
//I changed the player by making him a different sprite and making it yellow.I added a audio when you collect the cookies. I created enemies that jump around and you have to aviod them. I made the background a different by adding clouds.
//I am most pruod of my cookie tokens because they took the longest time to actually work.
//the unity kept on glitching and freezing so i had to restart my computer many times, yet it still refused to work and deleted half of my work. Unfortunetly I was not able to make my game better because of these unfortunate curcumstances. 
//You are the best teacher and I had fun in your class! have a great summer!! :)
